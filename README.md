vagrant-centos65-jboss7
=======================
This gets as far as installing wget, curl, openjdk 1.7.0 and unpacking JBoss 7.1.1.

Where it goes sideways is in trying to create a user with add-user.sh from the command line.

This still has localhost, 127.0.0.1, and VBox NAT ip addys all over so watch out for those.
